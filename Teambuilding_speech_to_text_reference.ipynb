        "\n",
        "- **Tourism's Contribution to the Economy**:\n",
        "  - The audio states, \"The tourism sector contributes to one-quarter of our local economy.\"\n",
        "  - This argument is found on slide 2, in the infographic titled **\"SUSTAINABLE TOURISM\"**.\n",
        "  - The infographic highlights:\n",
        "    - \"Tourism is responsible for 235 million jobs in the world.\"\n",
        "    - Tourism is the \"Main income source for many developing countries.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Argument Against Investing in Tourism\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Environmental Impact**:\n",
        "  - The opposing team suggests investing in upgrading sugarcane plantations to be more resistant to rising water temperatures caused by the increased carbon footprint of tourist activity.\n",
        "  - This argument is based on the information provided on slide 3, which states:\n",
        "    - \"The growth of tourism and sugar plantations industries has [an] impact on the biodiversity of the country.\"\n",
        "    - Highlights the \"ecological destruction\" caused by tourism-related activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Impact of Natural Disasters**:\n",
        "  - The audio mentions the impact of natural disasters on sugarcane plantations. However, this point is refuted as not being directly related to the carbon footprint of tourism.\n",
